### Proposing a new project

- To propose a project, we ask that you create a short project document and gather the interest of at least three people from 2 different member organizations.

- Reach out to the chairs, who will add you to the next working group meeting agenda.

- If the working group reaches consensus and agrees, your project will be made official and start receiving the support of the Foundation.

- However, often it requires several conversations with the working group to evolve your project proposal to a version where everyone is comfortable.

- Once launched, the working group will support you in executing your project and source the resources required from the Foundation and its members.
